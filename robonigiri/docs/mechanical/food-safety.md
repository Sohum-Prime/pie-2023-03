Since we are working with food in our design, we decided that it would be best if
we did some research into food compliant materials, as we didn't want to make a
product that would harm our customers in the long term.

We began by looking into the different types of 3D printer filament and whether
they were food-safe. This was an important step in our design process as
the majority of our parts were 3D printed, so we needed to ensure that any parts
touching the food were either printed from the most food-safe option or change
our design so the rice somehow did not need to touch the 3D-printed parts.
